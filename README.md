# NeuNet
A Neural Network made from scratch in java

## How it works
TODO

## The objective
The Neural network's objective will be to balance a single pendulum upwards

(Yes I got the idea from a YouTuube video, canot find it, will later)

## The Network
The network will have 4 Inputs and one output

Inputs:
- The cart's x position
- The cart's speed
- The Pendulum's angle
- The Penddulum's speed

Outputs:
- The carts speed
> [!NOTE]
> Might change to acceleration

## The Training
Not there yet...

## Results
I wish
