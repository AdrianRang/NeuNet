# NeuNet
A Neural Network made from scratch in java

## How it works
TODO

## The objective
The Neural network's objective will be to balance a single pendulum upwards

(Yes I got the idea from a YouTuube video, canot find it, will later)

## The Network
The network will have 4 Inputs and one output

Inputs:
- The cart's x position
- The cart's speed
- The Pendulum's angle
- The Penddulum's speed

Outputs:
- The carts speed
> [!NOTE]
> Might change to acceleration

## The Training
It trains, can generate great outputs but it is still a bit unreliable, takes a while, in the out directory there's the score of all generations sorted from most to least, note that after wow I changed the evaluation function to take into account distance from center.

## Results

(Note that the renderer broke somewhere along the way of coppying networks)
